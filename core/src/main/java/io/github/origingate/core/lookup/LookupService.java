/**
 * Finds IP data in this order: the address in memory, the address in storage, an answer kept for its IPv6 /64, then
 * the providers. Only one lookup per address runs at a time; other callers share its result. Answers are kept per
 * address. An IPv6 answer that a rule would act on (see {@code sharedAcrossNetwork}) is also kept for its whole /64, so
 * the next address in that /64 gets it from memory: home and mobile users can switch addresses inside their /64, but
 * hosts may split one /64 between customers, so a clean answer is never shared, and an address's own answer always
 * comes first. While the queue is backed up, a queued lookup whose callers have all stopped waiting is dropped before
 * any provider is asked. Storage errors are logged and skipped, never fatal, and after one, storage is left alone for
 * {@link #STORAGE_PAUSE} so a dead database does not slow logins.
